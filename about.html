                    <p>Hello to all those wonderful poodle loving humans. You may already have one of my beautiful parti poodles or are looking at acquiring one in the future, but here is a little bit of history about me and how I ended up breeding these wonderfully intelligent, intuitive and gorgeous creatures.</p>
                    <p>I grew up with my siblings in my father‚Äôs vet clinic where I spent most of my spare time. I had three favourite places. I was either on my horse which I rode for hours most days including the 8km ride to school and home again every day. Or I was in the old Toyota tracking around with dad to all the district‚Äôs farms even at 2am in the cold, wet, snow of winter with freezing fingers holding the torch, instrument tray or the medicines to help pull a calf out of a cow having trouble giving birth. Or I was in the clinic holding up veins on dog‚Äôs front legs so dad could easily perform an IV which I would then lift my fingers once the needle slid in.</p>
                    
                    <div class="pull-quote">

                    <h3 id="puppy-beginnings">Family Memories and Puppy Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>However my fondest memories are those of all of us kids and mum having been called in to do a caesarean section on a dog. As dad would begin to pull out one puppy at a time, we all had a towel ready for each puppy and would be instructed to rub up and down their tiny limp bodies between our hands with the towel quite rigorously until we heard a squeak. ‚ÄúKEEP RUBBING‚Äù dad would say. Our little kid arms burning with the effort but never stopping until the little puppy was squirming and squealing in our little hands. We would pull the cat gut stitch material out of the roll for dad to help with what seemed like hundreds of sutures for the mother who lay unconscious and unknowing. Wow, wouldn‚Äôt she get a surprise when she woke up!!</p>
                    <p>We always had hunting dogs, sheep dogs, Blue heelers and terriers. We spent so much time with them and especially when sometimes as kids we would discover a litter in a kennel. How we were never bitten by the hunting hounds as we used to spend hours sitting in these kennels with all the puppies completely oblivious to the dangers that these over protective mums never turned their protective instincts on us. But by golly if anyone else walked past be it human or dog they would certainly with no uncertain terms scare them off for ever!!!</p>

                    <h3 id="discovering-poodles">Discovering the Standard Poodle</h3>
                    <p>As a teenager I had a GSP called Sunday and I also trained a couple of sheepdogs. It was at a sheepdog clinic I asked the instructor what his first dog was. He said ‚ÄúA STANDARD POODLE‚Äù. Everyone gasped that ‚ÄúOH NO! SURELY NOT A POODLE?‚Äù Anyway he could sense everyone‚Äôs sliding opinion of him so he told his story of how someone had advised him that he should get a Standard Poodle as his first dog as they are intelligent, loyal, loving but also so very VERSATILE. He said it was the best dog he ever had. I was hooked.</p>
                    <p>I then after doing a little researching discovered there were coloured ones called ‚Äúparti‚Äù. Of course 15-16 years ago there was none in Australia. So I looked further afield and over a couple of years sourced Passion and Kiwi from New Zealand which were my first two parti poodles. And now 16 years later I breed Standard Poodles for others so they too can experience these beautiful dogs and all they have to offer.</p>

                    <h3 id="philosophy">Our Breeding Philosophy & Practices</h3>
                    <p>As a breeder I absolutely do my best to try breed the best natured and most well put together poodles in the country. It has been a long journey with amazing results. Every dog I intend to breed is DNA tested with Embark USA which is an incredibly extensive test of the genetic makeup of the dog. All my dogs are ALL CLEAR in all diseases testable to ensure the best quality and peace of mind to anyone acquiring a puppy. Also parents are all hip tested and scored and will only be bred with if they meet recommendations. We no longer elbow score as they always came back with 0 score, unaffected.</p>

                    <p>Some litters I will DNA test every puppy if I am looking for something specific to breed on. This process is quite lengthy but most results I get back by 8-10 weeks of age. The mums are very precious and spend the two weeks prior to giving birth in my bedroom with me where they stay for three weeks after the puppies are born ensuring I can keep a close eye on them in this very infant stage. Not much sleep with the squeaking and snuffling but never can I be separated in this very vulnerable time. Its worth it.</p>
                    <p>The puppies then move to live out in what I call the "puppy hut" which is a timber lined shed with heated floors and a split system to ensure constant temp whether summer or winter. From here they have full access to outside when they are ready which is about 3 ¬Ω weeks and they really begin their own toilet training. By four weeks they are venturing out to do their business on the grass outside their puppy hut. Even now with my 5 children (teens and early 20's) and their friends the puppies get lots of people exposure and fun time. Just can't not play with them, always just so super cute.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="future">Looking into the Future</h3>
                    <p>This year I have for the first time acquired three dogs who carry red. One of them is a Royal (Giant) Poodle, so for those who like BIG dogs I will hopefully be able to breed some puppies on the larger side with some really cool colours. I am in the process of rehoming about 5 of my adult dogs, something I do when they get to about 2-3 years old. I generally only let my girls have 1-2 litters before I place them with a new family. I think they deserve this. The boys I might occasionally keep a little longer or even younger. It really depends on many different factors. I definitely keep a very diverse genetic pool and steer well clear of line breeding. The health of my dogs is very important to me as I hope to pass each of you a healthy puppy which will live out long years in the family who have adopted him/her with as few health issues as possible.</p>
